## Description

Skillcert is platform for issuing NFT-based digital certificates on the Stellar blockchain, ensuring authenticity, traceability, and instant verification. It also features an educational marketplace for courses with automated validated certification.

We are currently in the integration phase between the Web3 logic and the frontend application. The majority of the smart contract functions and blockchain interaction logic have already been implemented and tested on the Web3 side. On the frontend, all core views and components have been developed, and the UI/UX structure is stable. At this stage, we are focusing on wiring together the frontend interfaces with the Web3 functionalitiesâ€”enabling user actions in the UI to trigger the corresponding smart contract calls and ensuring data from the blockchain is properly rendered on the client side. This step is essential to achieve full system functionality and user interaction flow.
